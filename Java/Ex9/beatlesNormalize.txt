formation hamburg and uk popularity
in march john lennon then aged sixteen formed a skiffle group with several friends from quarry bank high school in liverpool they briefly called themselves the blackjacks before changing their name to the quarrymen after discovering that another local group were already using the name fifteen year old paul mccartney joined them as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and lennon met that july in february mccartney invited his friend george harrison to watch the band the fifteen year old auditioned for lennon impressing him with his playing but lennon initially thought harrison was too young for the band after a month of harrisons persistence during a second meeting arranged by mccartney he performed the lead guitar part of the instrumental song raunchy on the upper deck of a liverpool bus and they enlisted him as their lead guitarist 

by january lennons quarry bank friends had left the group and he began his studies at the liverpool college of art the three guitarists billing themselves as johnny and the moondogs were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer lennons art school friend stuart sutcliffe who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar with the proceeds joined in january and it was he who suggested changing the bands name to beatals as a tribute to buddy holly and the crickets they used this name until may when they became the silver beetles before undertaking a brief tour of scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow liverpudlian johnny gentle by early july they had refashioned themselves as the silver beatles and by the middle of august shortened the name to the beatles 

allan williams the beatles unofficial manager arranged a residency for them in hamburg and for this they auditioned and hired drummer pete best in mid august the band now a five piece departed liverpool for hamburg four days later contracted to club owner bruno koschmider for what would be a month residency beatles historian mark lewisohn writes they pulled into hamburg at dusk on august the time when the red light area comes to life flashing neon lights screamed out the various entertainment on offer while scantily clad women sat unabashed in shop windows waiting for business opportunities 

koschmider had converted a couple of strip clubs in the district into music venues and he initially placed the beatles at the indra club after closing indra due to noise complaints he moved them to the kaiserkeller in october when he learned they had been performing at the rival top ten club in breach of their contract he gave the band one months termination notice and reported the underage harrison who had obtained permission to stay in hamburg by lying to the german authorities about his age the authorities arranged for harrisons deportation in late november one week later koschmider had mccartney and best arrested for arson after they set fire to a condom in a concrete corridor the authorities deported them lennon returned to liverpool in early december while sutcliffe remained in hamburg until late february with his german fianc e astrid kirchherr who took the first semi professional photos of the beatles 

during the next two years the beatles were resident for periods in hamburg where they used preludin both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all night performances in during their second hamburg engagement kirchherr cut sutcliffes hair in the exi existentialist style later adopted by the other beatles when sutcliffe decided to leave the band early that year and resume his art studies in germany mccartney took up the bass producer bert kaempfert contracted what was now a four piece group until june and he used them as tony sheridans backing band on a series of recordings for polydor records as part of the sessions the beatles were signed to polydor for one year credited to tony sheridan the beat brothers the single my bonnie recorded in june and released four months later reached number on the musikmarkt chart 

after the beatles completed their second hamburg residency they enjoyed increasing popularity in liverpool with the growing merseybeat movement however they were also growing tired of the monotony of numerous appearances at the same clubs night after night in november during one of the groups frequent performances at the cavern club they encountered brian epstein a local record store owner and music columnist he later recalled i immediately liked what i heard they were fresh and they were honest and they had what i thought was a sort of presence a star quality 

epstein courted the band over the next couple of months and they appointed him as their manager in january throughout early and mid epstein sought to free the beatles from their contractual obligations to bert kaempfert productions he eventually negotiated a one month early release from their contract in exchange for one last recording session in hamburg tragedy greeted them on their return to germany in april when a distraught kirchherr met them at the airport with news of sutcliffes death the previous day from what was later determined as a brain haemorrhage 

epstein began negotiations with record labels for a recording contract to secure a uk record contract epstein negotiated an early end to the bands contract with polydor in exchange for more recordings backing tony sheridan after a new years day audition decca records rejected the band with the comment guitar groups are on the way out mr epstein however three months later producer george martin signed the beatles to emis parlophone label

main entrance at abbey road studios
martins first recording session with the beatles took place at emis abbey road studios in london on june martin immediately complained to epstein about bests poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place already contemplating bests dismissal the beatles replaced him in mid august with ringo starr who left rory storm and the hurricanes to join them a september session at emi yielded a recording of love me do featuring starr on drums but a dissatisfied martin hired drummer andy white for the bands third session a week later which produced recordings of love me do please please me and p s i love you 

martin initially selected the starr version of love me do for the bands first single though subsequent re pressings featured the white version with starr on tambourine released in early october love me do peaked at number seventeen on the record retailer chart their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme people and places after martin suggested rerecording please please me at a faster tempo a studio session in late november yielded that recording of which martin accurately predicted youve just made your first no 

in december the beatles concluded their fifth and final hamburg residency by they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums including starr despite his restricted vocal range to validate his standing in the group lennon and mccartney had established a songwriting partnership and as the bands success grew their dominant collaboration limited harrisons opportunities as a lead vocalist epstein to maximise the beatles commercial potential encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing lennon recalled him saying look if you really want to get in these bigger places youre going to have to change stop eating on stage stop swearing stop smoking lennon said we used to dress how we liked on and off stage hed tell us that jeans were not particularly smart and could we possibly manage to wear proper trousers but he didnt want us suddenly looking square hed let us have our own sense of individuality

recalling how the beatles rushed to deliver a debut album bashing out please please me in a day allmusics stephen thomas erlewine comments decades after its release the album still sounds fresh precisely because of its intense origins lennon said little thought went into composition at the time he and mccartney were just writing songs la everly brothers la buddy holly pop songs with no more thought of them than that to create a sound and the words were almost irrelevant

the beatles first visit to the us took place when the nation were still mourning the assassination of president john f kennedy the previous november commentators often suggest that for many particularly the young the beatles performances reignited the sense of excitement and possibility that momentarily faded in the wake of the assassination and helped make way for the revolutionary social changes to come in the decade their hairstyle unusually long for the era and mocked by many adults became an emblem of rebellion to the burgeoning youth culture 

the groups popularity generated unprecedented interest in british music and many other uk acts subsequently made their american debuts successfully touring over the next three years in what was termed the british invasion the beatles success in the us opened the door for a successive string of british beat groups and pop acts such as the dave clark five the animals petula clark the kinks and the rolling stones to achieve success in america during the week of april the beatles held twelve positions on the billboard hot singles chart including the top five nb

touring internationally in june and july the beatles staged shows over days in denmark the netherlands hong kong australia and new zealand nb in august and september they returned to the us with a concert tour of cities generating intense interest once again the month long tour attracted between and fans to each minute performance in cities from san francisco to new york 

in august journalist al aronowitz arranged for the beatles to meet bob dylan visiting the band in their new york hotel suite dylan introduced them to cannabis gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting before which the musicians respective fanbases were perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds dylans audience of college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings a dawning political and social idealism and a mildly bohemian style contrasted with their fans veritable teenyboppers kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television radio pop records fan magazines and teen fashion to many of dylans followers in the folk music scene the beatles were seen as idolaters not idealists 

within six months of the meeting according to gould lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated dylans nasal drone brittle strum and introspective vocal persona and six months after that dylan began performing with a backing band and electric instrumentation and dressed in the height of mod fashion as a result gould continues the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts nearly evaporated as the beatles fans began to mature in their outlook and dylans audience embraced the new youth driven pop culture 

during the us tour the group were confronted with racial segregation in the country at the time when informed that the venue for their september concert the gator bowl in jacksonville florida was segregated the beatles said they would refuse to perform unless the audience was integrated lennon stated we never play to segregated audiences and we arent going to start now id sooner lose our appearance money city officials relented and agreed to allow an integrated show the group also cancelled their reservations at the whites only hotel george washington in jacksonville for their subsequent us tours in and the beatles included clauses in contracts stipulating that shows be integrated

in early following a dinner with lennon harrison and their wives harrisons dentist john riley secretly added lsd to their coffee lennon described the experience it was just terrifying but it was fantastic i was pretty stunned for a month or two he and harrison subsequently became regular users of the drug joined by starr on at least one occasion harrisons use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and hinduism he commented for me it was like a flash the first time i had acid it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me and i realized a lot of things i didnt learn them because i already knew them but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them from the moment i had that i wanted to have it all the time these thoughts about the yogis and the himalayas and ravis music mccartney was initially reluctant to try it but eventually did so in late he became the first beatle to discuss lsd publicly declaring in a magazine interview that it opened my eyes and made me a better more honest more tolerant member of society

in mid october the beatles entered the recording studio for the first time when making an album they had an extended period without other major commitments until this time according to george martin we had been making albums rather like a collection of singles now we were really beginning to think about albums as a bit of art on their own released in december rubber soul was hailed by critics as a major step forward in the maturity and complexity of the bands music their thematic reach was beginning to expand as they embraced deeper aspects of romance and philosophy a development that nems executive peter brown attributed to the band members now habitual use of marijuana lennon referred to rubber soul as the pot album and starr said grass was really influential in a lot of our changes especially with the writers and because they were writing different material we were playing differently after help s foray into classical music with flutes and strings harrisons introduction of a sitar on norwegian wood this bird has flown marked a further progression outside the traditional boundaries of popular music as their lyrics grew more artful fans began to study them for deeper meaning
